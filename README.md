Developed a full-featured Restaurant Management Web Application that allows users to browse the menu, place online orders, and make table reservations. The backend was built using Spring Boot for developing RESTful APIs and Hibernate for managing database operations. The application supports both customer and admin functionalities.

Key Features:

Built REST APIs with Spring Boot to handle customer registrations, menu retrieval, order processing, and reservations.

Used Hibernate ORM to map Java classes to MySQL tables and manage persistence operations.

Implemented CRUD operations for menu items, orders, and user profiles.

Designed the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a responsive user experience.

Used Postman for testing API endpoints and validating request/response flows.

Applied Spring Security (optional) to enable basic authentication for admin functions.

Ensured separation of concerns through layered architecture: Controller, Service, Repository, and Entity.
